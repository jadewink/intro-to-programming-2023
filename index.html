            <img src ="headshot.jpg" width="200px" />
            <p>As an accomplished web developer and an aspiring programmer, I have a proven track record of managing and executing creative projects. Balancing the demands 
                of being a mom of two amazing humans and one furry beast I excel in preparation and adaptability. Combined with my diverse technical background, 
                exceptional attention to detail, and stellar organizational skills, I deliver successful projects on time and within budget. 
                Driven by my career experiences I have developed a keen interest in coding, leading me to pursue independent study of programming. Thriving on complex 
                technical challenges, I am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge base, fostering collaboration, and driving collective success within any team 
                I join.</p>
